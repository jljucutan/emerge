If you fail to execute a separation agreement and general release provided by the Firm within the specified time period, you will forfeit the payment of your Year <$client.tForWhomUserInfo.SMC_Bonus_Year> Guarantee (unless you have initiated a formal appeal process under the Firm’s severance policy as may be in effect at the time in a timely manner in which case any amounts payable to you will be made in accordance with and as specified in such severance policy).

        </p>
        <p>
            This Replacement Deferred Cash Award is subject to receipt by the Firm of such documentation as it may reasonably require from you and/or your former employer, verifying the Holdings and confirming the Holdings forfeited. The documentation must be provided within 30 calendar days of your Start Date and should be forwarded to Sh-Comp-Americas@ubs.com or you may forfeit the right to the Replacement Deferred Cash Award.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Payment of each vested installment will be made (less applicable withholdings and deductions) on March 31st (or within 15 business days thereof) in the year of the vesting of the corresponding installment.

        </p>
        <p>
            The value of your forfeited Holdings will be determined based on its cash value and/or the average high and low market price of any underlying shares or other vehicles on your Start Date (the 'Forfeited Value'). Where a market price is not available for that date, the last available pricing prior to that da e shall be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            b.  Calculation of Replacement Award
        </p>
        <p>
            The Replacement Deferred Cash Award will equal the Forfeited Value converted into USD using the spot FX rate on or immediately before your Start Date, if required.
        </p>
