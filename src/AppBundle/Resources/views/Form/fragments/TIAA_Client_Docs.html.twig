				<h5>
					<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY AND MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION (“MNPI”) POLICY</strong>
				</h5>

				<p>
					This Confidentiality MNPI Policy should be read in conjunction with the “Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement, Affirmation, and Acknowledgement of Receipt and Understanding of Contingent Worker Program Policy Handbook” that each contingent worker must sign at the conclusion of this Handbook. In the ordinary course of its business, TIAA obtains, develops, and maintains a broad variety of non-public personal, financial, and other proprietary information. TIAA’s policy prohibits the disclosure or use of any such non-public information (“Confidential Information”) that it obtains or develops except for clearly defined and authorized legitimate business purposes. Confidential Information is not to be used to the detriment of TIAA or for the personal gain of any individual. <strong>Vendors and their Representatives must comply with this Policy</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Most businesses and individuals closely guard the confidentiality and privacy of their business and financial affairs. The trust placed in TIAA could be irreparably damaged if Confidential Information furnished to it by its constituents, including policyholders, participating institutions, borrowers, participants, clients, and employees, is disclosed to others. The protection of other Confidential Information of TIAA, including, but not limited to, business information, plans, and strategies developed within TIAA, is equally important. In the intensely competitive environment in which TIAA operates, the disclosure to outsiders of TIAA's strategic plans, new product development, and/or pricing policies, among other Confidential Information, could be damaging to TIAA. Vendors and contingent workers must constantly be aware of the importance or sensitive nature of the information they handle on TIAA’s behalf and the potential harm that could result from the inadvertent disclosure of that information.
				</p>

				<p>
					The following governs the use and disclosure of Confidential Information at TIAA:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						TIAA will not disclose Confidential Information to third-parties, except as authorized by the constituent, as legally required, and/or as necessary in the exercise of TIAA's legitimate business obligations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Confidential Information concerning TIAA's constituents or TIAA's business activities and plans will be used and/or disclosed only to those within TIAA who have a legitimate need to know or use such information in the performance of their jobs. Confidential Information should not be discussed by any TIAA employee with any third-party, including, but not limited to, family members and friends.
					</li>
					<li>
						TIAA has administrative procedures and physical safeguards to ensure that Confidential Information concerning its constituents or that it has obtained and/or developed is securely maintained, and that the custodians of such Confidential Information are aware that its confidentiality must be protected.
					</li>
					<li>
						Confidential Information maintained or developed by TIAA for its legitimate business purposes may not be used for the personal gain or benefit of any employee or any other entity or individual.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Additionally, federal law prohibits the purchase or sale of securities by any entity or individual possessing MNPI. TIAA has established and maintains and enforces written procedures to prevent the misuse of MNPI. Contingent workers assigned to TIAA must not purchase or sell securities while in possession of MNPI relating to securities or proprietary funds and accounts. Additionally, contingent workers must comply with any and all “access person” requirements of TIAA and may not communicate such MNPI to others or cause others to trade based upon such MNPI. MNPI is defined as information that is both “Material” as it relates to a security and to TIAA’s proprietary funds and accounts, and “Nonpublic”. Information is deemed “Material” if:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						There is a substantial likelihood a “reasonable investor” would consider the information important in making an investment decision;
					</li>
					<li>
						Disclosure of the information would be viewed by reasonable investors as having significantly altered the “total mix” of information made available;
					</li>
					<li>
						Disclosure is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the market price of the security; or
					</li>
					<li>
						Disclosure is reasonably certain to have a substantial effect on the NAV/AUV of TIAA’s proprietary funds and accounts
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Information is deemed “Non-Public” if it has not been disseminated such that it is generally available to investors or the securities markets. Violations of these provisions will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of assignment and/or engagement. Additionally, trading, “tipping” and/or aiding or abetting those trading on the basis of MNPI may subject the individual and/or any other third-party acting in concert with the individual to civil and criminal penalties such as injunctions, penalties, disgorgement of profits, fines, and jail sentences.
				</p>

				<p>
					Contingent workers in possession of MNPI or what he or she believes to be MNPI, shall:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Immediately contact a compliance officer in TIAA’s Asset Management Compliance or an attorney in TIAA’s Law Department
					</li>
					<li>
						Not purchase or sell for themselves or others, any affected securities (including but not limited to, common stock, bonds, and other derivative or related securities such as options, warrants, rights, etc.) while in possession of MNPI
					</li>
					<li>
						Not purchase or sell for themselves or others, any affected TIAA proprietary funds and accounts
					</li>
					<li>
						Keep MNPI information confidential and not discuss or pass along such information or in any way “tip” others such that the recipient of the information might trade
					</li>
					<li>
						Comply with the appropriate guidelines and procedures for their assigned business area relating to MNPI
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>
					<strong>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION, NON-RETALIATION, AND ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY</strong>
				</h5>

				<p>
					TIAA is an equal employment opportunity employer, dedicated to maintaining a work environment free of bias, harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. TIAA does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, ethnicity, color, age, religion, sex, sex stereotype, pregnancy (including childbirth, breastfeeding or related medical conditions where applicable), sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, transgender, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, requesting a reasonable accommodation based on mental or physical disability, medical condition (as defined by applicable law), genetic history and information, citizenship status, military or veteran status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local law or ordinance or regulation (collectively referred to here as “protected characteristics”). Providing a safe, inclusive work environment for all is a priority at TIAA. Assuring the fair treatment of all is a corporate responsibility to be shared by all.
				</p>

				<p>
					TIAA is committed to providing equal employment opportunity as to all employment and workplace practices without regard to any individual’s protected characteristics. Discrimination or harassment based on any of these protected characteristics is illegal and will not be tolerated. TIAA will comply with all applicable federal, state and local equal employment opportunity laws and affirmative action regulations and executive orders.
				</p>

				<p>
					Harassment on the basis of any of the protected characteristics, individually or in combination, is prohibited and will not be tolerated. Unlawful harassment entails persistent and/or severe physical, emotional or verbal conduct on account of a person’s protected characteristic that is objectively and subjectively offensive and affects the victim’s terms and conditions of work and/or employment. Sexual harassment is one form of prohibited conduct; it is a form of gender-based discrimination and is illegal. The sexual harassment provisions and prohibitions here policy apply to men and women equally, and to same- and opposite-sex relationships or interactions. TIAA will not condone any conduct that constitutes harassment, and will not support any decisions based on illegal considerations. Specifically, sexual harassment involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (a) submitting to such conduct is made a condition of work and/or employment, or (b) submission to or rejection of such conduct is the basis of any decision in the workplace, or (c) such conduct creates an intimidating, offensive or hostile work environment or interferes with an individual's work performance or other terms and conditions of work and/or employment.
				</p>

				<p>
					TIAA also prohibits any individual from taking adverse action or otherwise retaliating against anyone whose complaint of discrimination or harassment on the basis of an individual’s protected characteristic(s) is made in good faith. Retaliation will not be tolerated and is a form of discrimination. If an individual engages in retaliation, he or she will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of assignment and/or engagement. Similar disciplinary action may be also taken for such complaints, however, if not brought in good faith.
				</p>

				<p>
					Any individual who believes that he or she, or any other individual, may be the victim of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation is urged to take advantage of TIAA’s internal procedures and resources for registering, hearing and responding to such concerns and complaints. Complaints, concerns, questions and requests for advice regarding discrimination or harassment, including, but not limited to sexual harassment, should be brought promptly to the attention of any of the following:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Your Human Resources contact at your employer (TIAA’s vendor); OR
					</li>
					<li>
						Your TIAA Project Contact ( if he/she is unavailable or if you believe it would be inappropriate or uncomfortable to contact that person) then: 
						<ul>
							<li>
								A member of TIAA’s Contingent Worker Program Management and/or Strategic Sourcing; OR
							</li>
							<li>
								The TIAA Ethics Helpline at 877-774-6492 (Toll Free number)
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					These provisions apply any relationship involving any TIAA employee and/or contingent worker or other non-employee assigned to or present at TIAA. Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of an assignment and/or engagement. TIAA expects all vendors doing business with TIAA, and their Representatives, to comply with these provisions and any other applicable provision of TIAA’s Equal Employment Opportunity Policy found here.
				</p>

				<h5>
					<strong>COMPLIANCE WITH LEAVE LAWS</strong>
				</h5>

				<p>
					TIAA engages in good faith efforts to comply fully with the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and related regulations or state or local laws, including those involve leave of absence (“Leave Laws”). Because TIAA does not employ contingent workers, TIAA will comply with any obligation under any Leave Law to the fullest extent required by such Leave Law that may prohibit interference with or discouragement of any exercise of any entitlement under such Leave Law.
				</p>

				<h5>
					<strong>SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY</strong>
				</h5>

				<p>

Contingent workers assigned to TIAA who engage in conduct prohibited by this Policy or is under the influence of any controlled substance, including alcohol and/or marijuana, while at the workplace or on TIAA premises (including, but not limited to, any vehicle) will be subject to immediate termination of assignment and/or engagement. TIAA cooperates with law enforcement agencies conducting investigations of alleged illegal activity involving employees and contingent workers assigned to TIAA. If a contingent worker is arrested and/or convicted for the use, possession, sale, or attempted sale of illegal drugs (either on or off premises), TIAA reserves the right to terminate the assignment and/or engagement.

				<h5>
					<strong>Internal Social Media Policy</strong>

					TIAA is subject to FINRA and SEC rules requiring firms to retain records of communications that relate to their businesses, including postings on external and internal social media sites. This Policy recognizes the benefits and risks of social media among internal stakeholders.
				</p>
