                It is hereby agreed that this Agreement and the Employee's employment with
                the Company is subject to and conditional upon the results and outcome of the

                was collected by the Company during the process of the Employee's
                recruitment to the Company. If the background checks are not satisfactory to
                the Company (as determined by it in its sole discretion), then this Agreement
                shall have no force or effect and, for the avoidance of doubt, will not bind the
