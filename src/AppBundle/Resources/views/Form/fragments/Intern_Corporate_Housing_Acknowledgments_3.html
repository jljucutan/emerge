                    <p>Apple’s housing vendor contracts with several apartment complexes near your work location or within close proximity to an Apple shuttle stop, however in some cases your housing may be further from a shuttle stop or office location based on availability. You will be assigned a unit based on availability. Air conditioning is not available in all apartment units; however, portable air conditioners will be provided by Apple’s housing vendor.

                    <p>We reserve the right to reassign you to a different unit mid-internship if the need arises and when we need to consolidate back to long-term leases (typically during the August and September timeframe).</p>
                    <p>Housing is based on current expectations and if conditions change, Apple reserves the right to change our housing approach.</p>

                    <p>If you elect for corporate housing, whether you have a car, take public transportation or an Apple shuttle, you can expect an average of 60 minute door-to-door commute. We can not provide any guarantees that your commute will be a certain duration. You should also expect at least a 20 minute walk, in some cases it could be longer, to the nearest shuttle stop. Therefore, we strongly suggest you weigh that into your decision making process before opting into corporate housing as you will not be able to move units based on distance. The use of ride share options (e.g. Lyft or Uber) or a rental car for your daily convenience is strictly a personal decision and will not be reimbursed by Apple.</p>
                    <p>Commute times vary in all locations and commute options may be limited or different outside of Santa Clara Valley.</p>

                    <p>In shared housing, Apple also offers a housing option that ensures a safe, inclusive, and supportive living experience for those of any gender identity or gender expression, including allies who will actively contribute to an inclusive community. Roommates and housemates in gender inclusive housing are assigned to undergrad or graduate units without regard to gender.</p>
                    <p>Opting into Gender Inclusive housing means that you understand that being a part of this housing community, you will agree to help create and maintain a safe, inclusive and supportive living space that respects all gender identities and gender expressions and acknowledge that confidentiality is important to create a safe space for individuals. You also understand that if you (or your guests) fall below modeling respectful behaviors that ensure a safe and supportive environment, your housing options may be re-evaluated and may include reassignment or termination.</p>
                    <p>By initialing this section, it does not mean you are opting into Gender Inclusive housing. This is merely an acknowledgement of your understanding of this housing option.

                    <p>Corporate housing is considered an extension of the workplace, therefore, you are expected to follow Apple’s policies and guidelines. Hi-speed wifi will be provided in your unit, however you will need to be cognizant of work from home requirements for all roommate(s). High bandwidth activities such as gaming may be limited or not allowed.</p>
                    <p>While you may have a roommate or roommates that you do not always get along with, changing roommates is rarely allowed and as adults you are expected to work out your issues with one another.</p>
                    <p>Requests for moves will only be considered when the situation has escalated to a security or safety issue. In these extreme cases, University Relations, Employee Relations, the People Business Partner, your manager, and recruiting leader will be engaged to help work through the safety/security issue and requested housing move.</p>

                    <p>We strongly recommend purchasing or renting a bike to make your commute to/from the shuttle stop or work building easier. Commute coaches and shuttle vans are equipped to transport bikes. In SCV, a bicycle will be available for you to purchase directly from a designated vendor at an Apple discount. This purchase is entirely optional and is at your sole discretion. If you purchase a bike through a designated vendor, you will be responsible for its repair and storage. A bicycle safety helmet will be provided free to you when you successfully complete the Apple Bike Rider safety compliance course through Apple Commute. Do not park bikes in apartment complex parking lots or store them on your back patio.</p>

                    <p>For interns with vehicles, if possible, each apartment is assigned one designated parking space in most locations including Santa Clara Valley, however parking in certain locations such as New York City is not provided. It is your responsibility to confirm the location of your designated parking space. If sharing housing and more than one intern in your apartment unit has a car, you should work out a mutually agreeable parking space sharing agreement with your roommate. Cars will be subject to towing without notice and at your sole expense if parked illegally, in designated spaces, or in another resident’s parking space. Parking spaces should not be used for storage. Any property other than an automobile stored in your designated parking space will be considered trash and removed immediately by property management. Apple does not reimburse for additional assigned parking space fees. You are responsible for parking space fees or parking space fee policy changes made by individual apartment complexes during your stay in corporate housing. Additional spaces are available on a first-come, firstserved basis and are not guaranteed. Pricing and availability vary by property.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Your apartment will be thoroughly cleaned, sanitized, and bedbug-free certified prior to your move-in date. You will be responsible for maintaining your apartment in good condition. This includes notifying Apple’s Housing Vendor as soon as possible if you notice any leaks, mold, or other such issues. You may be charged for any damage and excessive cleaning fees after you move out. Failure to comply with scheduled cleaning, or failure to clean or remove trash from your room, may result in cleaning fees and/or your removal from corporate housing.</p>
                    <p>Biweekly maid service (light dusting, vacuuming, and bathroom and kitchen sanitizing) will be provided, and you will be notified of the housekeeping schedule upon arrival. Apple’s Housing Vendor’s housekeeping will not pick up or touch personal items that may prevent the team from completing the cleaning. Prior to the scheduled cleaning, floors and beds should be cleared to allow for proper vacuuming and linen changes. Do not mix personal linens (sheets, towels, pillow cases, and so on) with Apple’s Housing Vendor linens. Apple University Relations will be notified if scheduled housekeeping cleanings are missed due to uncleared beds and floors or if excessive trash is not removed on a weekly basis. Additional cleaning fees may be equally charged to the intern residents if Apple’s Housing Vendor’s housekeeping is required to dispose of excessive trash.</p>
                    <p>Shared apartment units and bedrooms require diligent upkeep and cleaning between the biweekly housekeeping service, and this is especially true when new interns arrive; therefore, you are expected to keep your living quarters neat and tidy.</p>
