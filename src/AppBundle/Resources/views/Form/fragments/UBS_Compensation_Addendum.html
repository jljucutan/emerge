</p>
<p>
<span style="display: block;"><strong><u><i>Compensation Awards</i></u></strong></span>
<span style="display: block;">You are eligible for the following additional compensation awards: {{Compensation_Awards_String}} (the 'Compensation Awards').  In addition to the specific terms and conditions set forth below, please note that all Compensation Awards are subject to the following terms:</span>
<ul>
<li>If, on or before the Payment Date or vesting date for any of the Compensation Awards (as defined herein), a Forfeiture Event (as defined herein) occurs, then the amount of your unpaid or unvested Compensation Awards shall be reduced by such amount as UBS shall in its absolute discretion determine, taking account of your performance and/or conduct, the circumstances surrounding your performance and/or conduct, and their consequences and/or potential consequences for you and/or the Firm and/or any other UBS Group entity.</li>
<li>Subject to applicable law, unless specifically set forth herein, you are only eligible to receive the Compensation Awards if you are employed with the Firm on the day that they are paid and/or granted. You will not be considered ‘employed’ if you or the Firm have given notice of termination prior to such date.</li>
<li>UBS retains the right to amend the terms of the Compensation Awards in the future if necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or any changes in applicable law, rules or regulations or in the interpretation thereof by any regulator, agency or tribunal of competent jurisdiction.</li>
<li>For purposes of the Offer Letter and its addenda, the phrase ‘409A Separation from Service’ will refer to your ‘separation from service’ within the meaning of Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (‘Section 409A’) and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  Your 409A Separation from Service will generally be deemed to occur on your first off-premises date, or such other time as Section 409A provides, even if you remain on payroll as of such date.</li>
</ul>
{{#GuaranteeNotNull_TargetNull_Year_1}}
<p>
<span style="display: block;"><strong><u><i>Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Incentive Compensation</i></u></strong></span>
<span style="display: block;">Exceptionally in your case, UBS will guarantee that if UBS Group AG achieves an Operating Profit (as defined below) for the calendar year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}}{{#GTE_Yr1_Perf_Objectives}} and if you successfully achieve your individual performance objectives as outlined below{{/GTE_Yr1_Perf_Objectives}}, you will be paid an incentive compensation award for calendar year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}}  under the discretionary performance incentive program as described above of ${{GTE_Amount_Year_1}} {{#GTE_Amount_Prorated_Year_1}}pro-rated to reflect the percentage of the calendar year that you were actually employed by the Firm {{/GTE_Amount_Prorated_Year_1}}(‘Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee’), provided that you remain employed on the Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}}  Awards, as defined herein.  This will be paid in accordance with the applicable compensation plans in force on the day of payment.  This does not however guarantee you any minimum incentive award for future years or set an expectation for future incentive amounts (whether under the discretionary incentive program or otherwise).</span>
</p>
<p>
In order to be eligible for a guaranteed incentive award, the following {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} individual performance objective(s) must be met to the satisfaction of UBS in its absolute discretion: 
</p>
<ul>
{{#GTE_Yr1_Perf_Objectives}}<li>{{{GTE_Yr1_Perf_Objectives}}}</li>{{/GTE_Yr1_Perf_Objectives}}
<li>Meet appropriate risk standards set by management, including: (i) conducting responsible risk-taking behavior by pursuing business with defined levels of risk-return; (ii) contributing to efficient use/allocation of capital and resources within the organization; (iii) being accountable for individual decisions including reputational and operational risks; and (iv) managing risk prudently to ensure long-term sustainable results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A portion of this incentive compensation award will be granted in the form of an EOP award and a portion will be granted in the form of a DCCP award (as detailed below), subject to the terms and conditions of the EOP and DCCP, respectively, on the date of grant.  EOP awards are granted 100% in the form of notional Shares (as the term ‘UBS share’ is defined in the EOP), with 50% of the award vesting and payable on March 1, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_3}} and the remaining 50% of the award vesting and payable on March 1, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_4}}, contingent upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions under the EOP Plan Rules and Award Agreement, subject to such additional payment provisions as are provided in the EOP Plan Rules as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Offer Letter.  DCCP awards are subject to a five-year cliff vesting requirement, with 100% of the award vesting and payable on March 1, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_6}}, contingent upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions under the DCCP Plan Rules and Award Agreement, subject to such additional payment provisions as are provided in the DCCP Plan Rules as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Offer Letter. UBS reserves the right to modify or discontinue the terms or the design of the EOP and the DCCP in the future, or to pay your deferred awards in a form other than notional UBS shares under EOP or awards under DCCP, as the case may be; provided, however, that no such modification may result in you receiving an award in respect of your {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee that will subject you to any additional tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (‘Section 409A’).
</p>
<p>
Subject to the conditions set forth above, your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee will be provided as follows: ${{GTE_Amount_Year_1}} paid in cash in {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_1}}, on or prior to March 15, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_1}}; ${{GTE_Amount_Year_1}} through the grant of an EOP award, subject to the terms and conditions of the EOP; and ${{GTE_Amount_Year_1}} through the grant of a DCCP award, subject to the terms and conditions of the DCCP.  Any {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} incentive compensation award above the level of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee will be in the sole and exclusive discretion of management and will be paid in cash, through the grant of EOP and/or DCCP awards (subject to then-applicable plan rules), and/or in such other form or forms and in such amounts as management shall determine in its sole and exclusive discretion.
</p>
<p>
Should you terminate your employment voluntarily or provide notice of your intent to terminate your employment voluntarily, or should we terminate your employment for Cause (as defined in this Offer Letter) before the Payment Date of Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} incentive compensation awards, currently anticipated to occur in or around mid-February to early March {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_1}}, but not later than March 15, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_1}} (the ‘Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Awards’), you will be paid only {{#FLSA_Status_Exempt}}your base salary{{/FLSA_Status_Exempt}}{{#FLSA_Status_Non_Exempt}}your base compensation{{/FLSA_Status_Non_Exempt}} earned through the date of termination and shall not be eligible to receive unpaid incentive compensation award payment(s).  However, following your Start Date, should you terminate employment due to death or disability (as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) ('Disability') or should we terminate you other than for Cause before the Payment Date for the Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee, and the Operating Profit requirement set forth above is satisfied, you will be entitled to the Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}}  Guarantee to be paid, subject to your (or your estate's) execution and non-revocation of a separation agreement and general release in form then provided by the Firm within sixty (60) days following the date of your 409A Separation from Service (it being understood that you will have not less than 21 days to review any such release before signature). If the above contingencies are satisfied, the cash portion will be paid in {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_1}}, by the later of (i) March 15, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1_Plus_1}}, and (ii) within 60 days after the execution and non-revocation of the separation agreement and general release, the deferred portion under EOP will be granted as an off-cycle cash award, and the deferred portion under DCCP will be granted as an off-cycle DCCP award, with such deferred portions granted under the applicable plans and off-cycle appendices, with the timing of the grants of such off-cycle awards to be consistent with the timing of when such grants would have been made if had remained employed on the Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Awards, provided that, if the execution and non-revocation of the separation agreement and release occurs after what would have otherwise been the grant date, such grants will be made on the fifth trading day of the month immediately following execution and non-revocation of the separation agreement and release. For the avoidance of doubt, the vesting dates of such off-cycle EOP and DCCP awards will follow the same vesting dates as set forth above. If you fail to execute a separation agreement and general release provided by the Firm within the specified time period, you will forfeit the payment of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee (unless you have initiated a formal appeal process under the Firm’s severance policy as may be in effect at the time in a timely manner in which case any amounts payable to you will be made in accordance with and as specified in such severance policy).  This Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee only applies to the corresponding incentive year.  Future incentive compensation award(s), if any, may be higher or lower and are in the sole and exclusive discretion of management.</p>
<p>
Please note that should you resign or give notice of the resignation of your employment or if you are terminated for Cause within one year following the Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Awards, you agree to repay the entire gross amount of the cash portion of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_1}} Guarantee within thirty (30) days after your termination date, regardless of the length of time you were employed by the Firm.

EOP awards are granted 100% in the form of notional UBS Shares (as the term ‘UBS share’ is defined in the EOP), with 50% of the award vesting and payable on March 1, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_3}} and the remaining 50% of the award vesting and payable on March 1, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_4}}, contingent upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions under the EOP Plan Rules and Award Agreement, subject to such additional payment provisions as are provided in the EOP Plan Rules as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Offer Letter.  DCCP awards are subject to a five-year cliff vesting requirement, with 100% of the award vesting and payable on March 1, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_6}}, contingent upon satisfaction of the terms and conditions under the DCCP Plan Rules and Award Agreement, subject to such additional payment provisions as are provided in the DCCP Plan Rules as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Offer Letter. UBS reserves the right to modify or discontinue the terms or the design of the EOP and the DCCP in the future, or to pay your deferred awards in a form other than notional UBS shares under EOP or awards under DCCP, as the case may be; provided, however, that no such modification may result in you receiving an award in respect of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Guarantee that will subject you to any additional tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (‘Section 409A’). 
</p>
<p>
Subject to the conditions set forth above, your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Guarantee will be provided as follows: ${{GTE_Amount_Year_3}} paid in cash in {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_1}}, on or prior to March 15, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_1}}; ${{GTE_Amount_Year_3}} through the grant of an EOP award, subject to the terms and conditions of the EOP; and ${{GTE_Amount_Year_3}} through the grant of a DCCP award, subject to the terms and conditions of the DCCP. Any {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} incentive compensation award above the level of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3} Guarantee will be in the sole and exclusive discretion of management and will be paid in cash, through the grant of EOP and/or DCCP awards (subject to then-applicable plan rules), and/or in such other form or forms and in such amounts as management shall determine in its sole and exclusive discretion. 
</p>
<p>
Should you terminate your employment voluntarily or provide notice of your intent to terminate your employment voluntarily, or should we terminate your employment for Cause (as defined in this Compensation Addendum) before the Payment Date of Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} incentive compensation awards, currently anticipated to occur in or around mid-February to early March {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_1}}, but not later than March 15, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_1}}, (the ‘Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Awards’), you will be paid only {{#FLSA_Status_Exempt}}your base salary{{/FLSA_Status_Exempt}}{{#FLSA_Status_Non_Exempt}}your base compensation{{/FLSA_Status_Non_Exempt}} earned through the date of termination and shall not be eligible to receive unpaid incentive compensation award payment(s).  However, following your Start Date, should you terminate employment due to death or disability (as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) ('Disability') or should we terminate you other than for Cause before the Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Awards, and the Operating Profit requirement set forth above is satisfied, you will be entitled to the Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Guarantee to be paid, subject to your (or your estate's) execution and non-revocation of a separation agreement and general release in form then provided by the Firm within sixty (60) days following the date of your 409A Separation from Service (it being understood that you will have not less than 21 days to review any such release before signature).  If the above contingencies are satisfied, the cash portion will be paid in {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_1}}, by the later of (i) March 15, {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3_Plus_1}}, and (ii) within 60 days after the execution and non-revocation of the separation agreement and general release, the deferred portion under EOP will be granted as an off-cycle cash award, and the deferred portion under DCCP will be granted as an off-cycle DCCP award, with such deferred portions granted under the applicable plans and off-cycle appendices, with the timing of the grants of such off-cycle awards to be consistent with the timing of when such grants would have been made if you had remained employed on the Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Awards, provided that, if the execution and non-revocation of the separation agreement and release occurs after what would have otherwise been the grant date, such grants will be made on the fifth trading day of the month immediately following execution and non-revocation of the separation agreement and release. For the avoidance of doubt, the vesting dates of such off-cycle EOP and DCCP awards will follow the same vesting dates as set forth above. If you fail to execute a separation agreement and general release provided by the Firm within the specified time period, you will forfeit the payment of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Guarantee (unless you have initiated a formal appeal process under the Firm’s severance policy as may be in effect at the time in a timely manner in which case any amounts payable to you will be made in accordance with and as specified in such severance policy).  This Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Guarantee only applies to the corresponding incentive year.  Future incentive compensation award(s), if any, may be higher or lower and are in the sole and exclusive discretion of management.
</p>
<p>
Please note that should you resign or give notice of the resignation of your employment within one year following the Payment Date for {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Awards, you agree to repay the entire gross amount of the cash portion of your Year {{GTE_Bonus_Year_3}} Guarantee within thirty (30) days after your termination date, regardless of the length of time you were employed by the Firm.

The value of your forfeited Holdings will be determined based on its cash value and/or the average high and low market price of any underlying shares or other vehicles on your Start Date (the 'Forfeited Value'). Where a market price is not available for that date, the last available pricing prior to that date shall be applied.
</p>
<p>b. Calculation of Replacement Award</p>
<p>
The initial value of the Replacement EOP will equal the Forfeited Value, converted into the relevant currency of the Notional Funds using the spot FX rate on or immediately before your Start Date, if required. Your Replacement EOP will be allocated against the value of the Notional Funds on the 5th trading day of the month following your date of hire and provision of full documentation (if administratively possible).
</p>
<p>
Your Replacement EOP will be granted on the 5th trading day of the month following your Start Date and provision of approved documentation (if administratively possible). You must accept the Replacement EOP within forty five (45) days of the grant date, or the award will be forfeited and you will have no further rights to it.  Please note that your Replacement EOP is governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable plan rules.
