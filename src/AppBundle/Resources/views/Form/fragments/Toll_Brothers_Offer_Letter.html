To allow for the streamlining of payroll processes among commonly owned companies, like Toll WA and Toll Bros., Inc., Washington law allows a "qualified employer of record" to provide paymaster services to affiliated businesses.  Paymaster services include payroll and related human resource services.  A "qualified employer of record" is someone who has no functional employment relationship with a qualified employee and no contractual liability with the qualified employee for employee costs.  A "functional employment relationship," on the other hand, means having control over the work schedule and activities of an employee and control over all employment decisions such as salary, discipline, hiring and layoffs.  Toll WA runs all of the operations in the State of Washington and will be your functional employer.  Toll Bros., Inc., which is responsible only for payroll and other related human resource services for Toll WA's operations, will be your "qualified employer of record."  That is why you will receive your paychecks and other employee benefits from Toll Bros and not from Toll WA. <br><br></div>
