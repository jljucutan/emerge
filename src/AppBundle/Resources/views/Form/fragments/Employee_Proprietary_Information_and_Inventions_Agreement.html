                Proprietary Information does not include information that

                court order or subpoena to the Legal Department of
                PayPal Holdings, Inc. and will cooperate with the
                appropriate PayPal Company to minimize the extent of
                any disclosure. I hereby assign to the Company any rights
                I may have or acquire in any and all Proprietary
                Information and recognize that all Proprietary Information
                shall be the sole and exclusive property of the PayPal

                confidence to a federal, state, or local government official,

                or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding,

                that if I file a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a
                suspected violation of law, I may disclose a trade secret to
                my attorney and use the trade secret information in the
                court proceeding, provided I file any document containing
                the trade secret under seal and do not disclose the trade
                secret other than pursuant to court order.

                    <strong class="indent">3.1 Prior Inventions; Third Party Software
                    Licenses. </strong>  I have disclosed in <u>Exhibit A</u> (Prior Inventions)
                    attached hereto a complete and accurate list describing all
                    Inventions that I have, or I have caused to be, alone or with
                    others, conceived, developed, made, or reduced to practice
                    prior to the commencement of my employment by the
                    Company, any other PayPal Company, or any affiliates or
                    predecessors, in which I or a third party have or purport to
                    have any ownership interest in or a license to use and wish
                    to have excluded from the scope of the assignment in
                    Section 3.2 of this Agreement (collectively referred to as
                    <strong>“Prior Inventions”</strong>). If disclosure of any such Prior
                    Invention would cause me to violate any prior
                    confidentiality agreement, I understand that I am not to
                    describe such Prior Inventions in <u>Exhibit A</u> but am only to
                    disclose a cursory name for each such invention, a listing
                    of the party(ies) to whom it belongs and the fact that full
                    disclosure as to such inventions has not been made for that
                    reason. A space is provided in <u>Exhibit A</u> for such purpose.
                    If no such disclosure is attached or no Prior Inventions are
                    described in <u>Exhibit A</u>, I represent and warrant that there
                    are no Prior Inventions. If I use any Prior Inventions
                    and/or Nonassignable Inventions in the scope of my
                    employment, or if I include any Prior Inventions and/or
                    Nonassignable Inventions in any product or service of any
                    PayPal Company, or if my rights in any Prior Inventions
                    and/or Nonassignable Inventions may block or interfere
                    with, or may otherwise be required for, the exercise by any
                    PayPal Company of any rights assigned to any PayPal
                    Company under this Agreement, I hereby grant each of the
                    PayPal Companies a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paidup and royalty-free, irrevocable and worldwide license
                    (with rights to sublicense through multiple levels of
                    sublicensees) to (a) reproduce, make derivative works of,
                    distribute, publicly perform, and publicly display in any
                    form or medium, whether now known or later developed, such Prior Inventions and/or Nonassignable Inventions;
                    (b) to make, have made, modify, use, sell, import, offer
                    for sale, and otherwise exploit any product or service that,
                    but for this license, would infringe any Intellectual
                    Property Rights in any such Prior Inventions and/or
                    Nonassignable Invention; and (c) exercise any and all
                    present or future rights in, such Prior Inventions and/or
                    Nonassignable Inventions. To the extent that any third
                    parties have any rights in or to any Prior Inventions and/or
                    Nonassignable Inventions, I hereby represent and warrant
                    that such third party or parties have validly granted to me
                    the right to grant the license stated above.
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, I agree that I will not use
                    any Prior Inventions and/or Nonassignable Inventions in
                    the scope of my employment, or include any Prior
                    Inventions and/or Nonassignable Inventions in any

                    express prior written consent of the legal department of
                    PayPal Holdings, Inc. In addition, I agree that I will not
                    incorporate into any PayPal Company software or
                    otherwise deliver to any PayPal Company any software
