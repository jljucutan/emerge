Holiday entitlement excluding public holidays accrues at the rate of 1/12th of your annual entitlement per completed month of service. Your Total annual holiday includes statutory, public and additional Company days. The Company's holiday year currently runs between 1st January and 31st December. The Total shown below is the number of weeks’ holiday you are entitled in a full holiday year. How many hours or days this provides depends on how many hours or days you are scheduled to work each week. So if you work 4 full days a week you are entitled to 4 days per week of holiday. If your hours vary each day but you perform 30 hours per week, you would be entitled to 30 hours of holiday per week of holiday. In each case your holiday entitlement is used against the hours or days you are usually scheduled to work each week. You do not need to take holiday for hours or days you are not usually scheduled to work. If a public holiday falls on a day you are usually scheduled to work, you must usually take this as part of your holiday allowance. Holiday is subject to the rules set out below and any additional rules set out in the Company’s holiday Policies (on the intranet or as notified to you) from time to time. The timing of all holidays must be agreed in advance with your manager.<br /><br />

Untaken holiday is cancelled if not taken either by the end of the holiday year or by the end of any permitted carry over period. The Company may notify you that the offices will be closed on other days, (deducted from your holiday entitlement), or for other reasons require you to take your holiday at times to suit the Company. You must take holiday on public holidays unless otherwise notified or agreed.<br /><br />
On termination of employment, payment for any accrued unused holiday will be calculated in accordance with applicable law and the Company may deduct from your final salary any holiday that has been taken but not yet earned.

<div><u>Immediate Termination</u>: Subject always to applicable law, the Company may also terminate your employment with immediate effect without notice and with no liability to make any further payment to you (other than amounts accrued due at the date of termination) if you: (a) commit any gross misconduct which is serious enough to justify such termination under applicable law, (and may include such conduct referenced in any disciplinary Policies or Company rules as gross misconduct); (b) commit any serious or repeated breach of this agreement or refuse or neglect to comply with any reasonable directions of the Company; (c) are, in the reasonable opinion of the Company seriously negligent or incompetent in the performance of your duties; (d) act in any manner which in the opinion of the Company is seriously adverse to the interests of or reputation of the Company or any Group Company or otherwise makes it unsuitable to continue with your employment (which may include the commission of any criminal offence, other than parking or minor traffic offences); (e) cease to be eligible to work in <strong>the UK</strong> or any other country necessary for the performance of your duties, (f) cease to hold any qualification which in the opinion of the Company is necessary for the performance of your duties; or (g) if your continued employment would be in breach of any applicable law or regulation.<br /><br />
The rights above are without prejudice to any Company right to terminate your employment at any time with or without notice in accordance with applicable law and any delay by the Company shall not waive any right to terminate. The Company may suspend you on full pay and benefits pending investigation into potential dishonesty, gross misconduct or other circumstances which might entitle the Company to dismiss you summarily in accordance with applicable law. Suspension is not a disciplinary action. Termination of your employment shall not affect any obligation in this Agreement expressly intended to continue after termination.<br /><br /></div>




<div><strong>PAYMENT IN LIEU OF NOTICE</strong><br /><br />
Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, the Company may in its sole discretion terminate your employment at any time with immediate effect or on a date specified in the future and make payment in lieu of any unexpired notice period (“<strong>Payment in Lieu</strong>”). There is no right to such termination and the Company may ask you to work your notice or place you on garden leave at its sole discretion. Any Payment in Lieu shall be calculated as the equivalent of your Base Salary in lieu of the unworked balance of your notice period less applicable deductions. Payment in lieu may be paid in instalments, on the dates when such salary would usually have been paid. The Payment in Lieu shall not include any bonus or commission, the value of any benefits or any holiday entitlement in each case that would have accrued or which relates to the period for which Payment in Lieu is made. <br /><br /></div>
<div><strong>GARDEN LEAVE</strong><br /><br />
At the Company’s sole discretion at any time during your employment (including during any notice period), you may be required not to perform some or all of your duties or to perform only specified duties and your powers may be restricted for any period (and such period is referred to as “<strong>Garden Leave Period</strong>”). Your duties may be different than prior to the Garden Leave Period if they are overall suitable for your role.
Subject to any other terms of this Agreement during any Garden Leave Period you shall continue to receive your salary and applicable contractual benefits subject to and if permitted by the terms of such benefit plans and you shall remain an employee of the Company and bound by the terms of this Agreement and your duty of fidelity and any other express or implied duties owed to the Company. If so instructed during any Garden Leave Period you shall (i) not without the Company’s consent attend your place of work or any other premises of the Company or any Group Company (ii) contact or deal with (or attempt to contact or deal with) any officer, employee, consultant, client, prospective client, customer, supplier, agent, distributor, shareholder, adviser or other business contact of the Company or any Group Company in connection with the business of the Company, (iii) cooperate to enable a smooth handover of your duties (iv) ensure you can be contacted during normal working hours or make yourself available for duties assigned to you during your Garden Leave Period (v) and cease to contact persons in connection with the business of the Company or attend company premises. You may be required to take any accrued unused holiday during any Garden Leave Period.<br /><br /></div>
<div><strong>OBLIGATIONS UPON TERMINATION</strong><br /><br />
On termination of your employment (howsoever arising) or if requested by the Company at any time (including after you or the Company has given notice of termination), you shall (a) immediately deliver to the Company all property of the Company (including all confidential information) which is in your possession or under your control and (b) irretrievably delete any information relating to the business of the Company or any Group Company stored in any form on any non-Company device in your possession or control and all matter derived from such sources save that before deleting such information, you shall ensure that the Company has a copy. If requested by the Company you shall provide a signed statement confirming whether you have complied with these obligations and if not, state in detail to what extent you have not complied and why. You hereby irrevocably consent to the Company taking whatever steps are reasonably necessary in your name to give the Company or its nominee the full benefit of this provision.  Prior to your termination date, you must also ensure another employee is aware of any passwords used by you in your employment to access documents, devices or locations to which no other employee has access. <br /><br />
At any time after termination of your employment you must not represent yourself as employed by or having any continuing connection with the Company or any Group Company.<br /><br />
On termination of your employment (howsoever arising) any rights in connection with any benefit plans or any incentive, bonus or any other plans in which you participated, whether administered by the Company or any Group Company shall cease on the termination date unless otherwise specified in such plans or notified by the Company and you shall have no other rights against the Company or any Group Company for the loss of any rights or benefits under such plans. <br /><br /></div>
<div><strong>RESTRICTIONS RE OTHER EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS & SUPPLIERS </strong><br /><br />
During your employment and for 12 months after the termination of your employment, unless you have the express written consent of the Company, you shall not directly or indirectly and whether on your own behalf or with or on behalf of any third party (i) employ, engage, conduct business with (or offer to do so) or endeavour to entice away from the Company or any Group Company any employee, or (ii) endeavour to entice away from the Company or any Group Company any other person providing services to the Company, each a “<strong>Prohibited Activity</strong>”, who in either case:<br /><br />
<div>  <table style="margin-left: 30px;">

     </tr>

For 12 months after termination of your employment you shall not adversely affect the supply of any goods or services to the Company or any Group Company.<br /><br /></div>

<div style="display:<$client.env.eval(client.tForWhomUserInfo.Salary_Grade_Level>=27?'block':'none')>">You shall observe the post-termination restrictions set out in Schedule 2 hereto.<br /><br /></div>



<div><strong>DISCIPLINARY AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES</strong><br /><br />
You are subject to the Company's disciplinary and grievance Policies which are available on the Company’s intranet and you must read. If you have any complaint about any disciplinary decision (including dismissal) you should contact your manager or MyHR in accordance with the disciplinary procedure. The Company may at any time suspend you from any or all of your duties while the Company is carrying out a disciplinary investigation or pending the result of any disciplinary hearing. During suspension the provisions relating to Garden Leave Period may be applied. If you are sick during suspension, the Company may withdraw suspension temporarily and resume suspension after the end of the sickness absence. If you wish to raise a grievance, you should raise this with your manager or with MyHR. If you have a complaint regarding how your grievance has been handled, you may appeal or raise your complaint with your manager or MyHR. Contact MyHR if you require assistance to locate the disciplinary or grievance procedure. The Company’s disciplinary and grievance procedures are not part of your contract of employment, give you no contractual rights and the Company may amend them at any time.<br /><br />
<strong>NOTICES & ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</strong><br /><br />
This clause does not apply to the service of legal proceedings by either party.  Communications regarding your employment including any notice of termination may be given in writing or electronically or digitally. Notice of termination may also be given verbally (and should then be confirmed in writing). The Parties agree that either the Company or you may sign or deliver any document electronically or digitally including using the software Docusign, or any other electronic software, without any formal signature. If any notice is sent by pre-paid recorded delivery or registered post to (i) the Company at its current registered office or (ii) you at your last known address, it shall be deemed received on the 2nd business day after posting unless there is evidence of earlier receipt.<br /><br />
<strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong><br /><br />
This is the entire contractual agreement between you and the Company regarding the matters set out in this agreement and supersedes all previous discussions and correspondence. You agree that you have not relied on any promise, statement or representation, (in writing or otherwise) of any person relating to your employment save as set out in this Agreement or implied by law and have no right of action in respect of any such promise, statement or representation.<br /><br /> 
Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud or which cannot be excluded by law. If the Company fails to exercise any right or remedy connected with this Agreement this shall not be a waiver of that right or remedy. <br /><br />
Variation of this Agreement must be in writing (which may include electronic communication) save that the Company may unilaterally make reasonable changes to any terms and conditions of your employment. Where practicable you will be provided with reasonable advance notice of such change. An operational practice is not an express or individual contractual agreement. Even repeated grants or benefits without express contractual agreement do not form a basis for claims in the future.<br /><br />
The provisions and sub-provisions of this Agreement and each identifiable part are severable and if any are held to be invalid or unenforceable this shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining parts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple copies and each when executed shall be an original.<br /><br />
Any Group Company may rely directly upon any term in this agreement for its benefit. Otherwise no other party shall have any rights under this Agreement. Save for any Group Company, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 doesn’t apply. <br /><br />
<strong>INTERPRETATION & DEFINITIONS</strong><br /><br />

<center><strong>Schedule 1<br /><br />Sickness Pay and Sickness Rules</strong></center><br /><br />
<ol>
<li>Contractual sickness absence and sick pay rules are set out below. Additional rules may be set out in any sickness absence Policies on the Company’s intranet or other rules notified to you and with which you must comply. Sickness absence policies may relax these rules in certain cases but the Company reserves the right to revert to these rules or set other rules at its discretion.</li> 
<li>The Company will not usually pay Discretionary Sick Pay in the following circumstances:
   <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li>during your probationary period 
      <li>during notice of termination of employment (whether given by the Company or you); 
      <li>if the Company has commenced any formal performance improvement process (PIP) or disciplinary process or notified you of an intention to do so or if any such hearing is pending or if you have an active disciplinary warning or are under a formal PIP; or
      <li>if the Company has commenced (or notified you of an intention to commence) any redundancy consultation process with you.</li>
    </ul>
Note: this is not an exhaustive list of the circumstances in which Discretionary Sick Pay may not be paid and payment remains in the sole discretion of the Company. The Company will comply with any obligation imposed by law, including regarding any disability, if applicable.</li>
<li>If the Company’s discretionary sick pay limits have been exhausted in any rolling 12 month period, then no further Discretionary Sick Pay is likely to be paid in respect of further absence relating to the same or similar causes in any subsequent period. </li>
<li>If you are unexpectedly absent from work for any reason you must inform the Company as soon as possible and in accordance with any rules set out on the Company’s intranet or other holiday Policies as varied from time to time. Failure to comply may lead to disciplinary action and may affect receipt of Statutory Sick Pay or Discretionary Sick Pay.  If you are off sick for more than 2 weeks, you must keep us informed of your situation at regular intervals (at least weekly unless we agree a longer period), whether you are improving and when you may be fit to return to work. The Company may require a medical opinion that you are fit to return before you are allowed to do so. </li>
<li><strong>Taking sick leave when you are not sick is dishonest and is considered to be gross misconduct and may lead to dismissal without notice or pay in lieu of notice.</strong></li>
<li>You agree to consent to medical examinations by a doctor nominated by the Company and at the Company's expense if the Company requires. Any subsequent report may be disclosed to the Company which may discuss its contents with the relevant doctor, subject to compliance with applicable law requirements.</li>
<li>If sickness absence is or appears to be occasioned by actionable negligence, nuisance or breach of any statutory duty on the part of a third party in respect of which damages are or may be recoverable, you shall immediately notify the Company. You will notify the Company of any claim, compromise, settlement or judgment made or awarded relating thereto and any other information reasonably required by the Company. To the extent that any third party is liable for loss of earnings for any period during which Discretionary Sick Pay has been paid, then such Discretionary Sick Pay shall be treated as a loan repayable by you on demand by the Company. The Company may at its discretion take into account any costs borne by you in connection with recovery of losses from the third party responsible in reducing the amount of any loan repayable.  </li>
