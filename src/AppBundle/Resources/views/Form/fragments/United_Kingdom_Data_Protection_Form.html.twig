                    The Data Protection Act 1998 sets out the principles that should be followed when processing personal data of any kind.  One of the ways in which PayPal UK Limited (“the Company”) takes steps to comply with some of these principles is to ask employees to consent to the processing of employment related personal data.  However, you should be aware that this is not the only way that the Company can comply with the principles contained in this Act.  You should be aware, however, that to carry out a variety of functions as an employer or to comply with legal obligations which are imposed upon the Company, we will not need your consent to process data in every case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We maintain certain personal information about employees as part of our general employee records.  Our records may include the Employee's address and contact details, marital status, educational background, employment application, history with the company, areas of expertise, details of salary and benefits, bank details, performance appraisals and salary reviews, records relating to holiday and other leave, working time records and other management records, etc. We have become aware of this information in a number of ways - directly from employees, from others and otherwise over time through our relationship with employees- and may receive and/or retain it in various forms, whether in writing, electronically, verbally or otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We use this information for a variety of personnel administration and employee, work and general business management purposes. For example, we need this information to administer payroll, improve and maintain the administration of employee benefits, such as leave entitlement, facilitate the management of work and employees, operate performance and salary reviews, operate the Company's IT and communications systems, comply with record keeping and other legal obligations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Company also processes information relating to employees health which may amount to sensitive personal data. The particular information that the Company holds relating to your health is the records of sickness absence and medical certificates, including the Company's Self Certified Sickness Form and any medical reports which employees have provided. The purpose of keeping this sort of information is to administer Company and Statutory Sick Pay, monitor and manage sickness absence and comply with obligations under Health and Safety legislation and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some of this personal information is stored and kept by PayPal Holdings Inc in databases located in the United States. The database is controlled by our administrative staff in the United States and can be accessed electronically by Human Resources, Business Systems Team, software maintenance vendors, and Stock Administration. The Company has security measures in place which help to ensure the confidentiality of the information contained in the database and these measures will be reviewed over time and upgraded in line with legal and technological developments. The remainder of the personal information is held on personnel files which are kept in the Human Resources Department. Access to these files is limited to local HR department and Stock Administration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From time to time, we will ask employees to review and update the personal information we hold. Please contact the Human Resources Department at any time for more information about the Data Protection Act and to obtain an up to date copy of the information held, subject to the various exceptions which are contained in the Data Protection Act.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a member of the PayPal group, the Company will need to make personal data and sensitive personal data available to PayPal Holdings Inc. and other members of the PayPal Group. for the purposes set out above and for use in internal newsletters of PayPal Holdings Inc. The Company will also need to make sensitive personal data available to legal and regulatory authorities (such as the Inland Revenue) to accountants, auditors, lawyers and other outside professional advisers, and to companies who provide products and services to the Company (such as IT systems suppliers, pension scheme or medical benefits providers and other outsourcing providers) or to any third parties assisting the Company, PayPal Holdings Inc. or any member of the PayPal group in the implementation, administration or management of any stock option, phantom option or employees' share scheme (present or future), including any broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares or common stock of the Company, PayPal Holdings Inc. or any other member of the PayPal group acquired by you (“Recipients”). Although most Recipients are located in the European Economic Area, others may be located or have relevant operations elsewhere. Therefore, it may be necessary to transfer sensitive personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area and, in particular, to the US. Some of the countries in which Recipients are located may not have laws as stringent as the UK laws which regulate the use and transfer of personal data. In this case, PayPal Holdings Inc will still hold your personal information safely and securely and will still comply with the underlying principles of the UK Data Protection Act.
