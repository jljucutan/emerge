                    You will be assigned roommates or house mates of your same gender, internship timeframe and the profile you completed with Apple's vendor, National Corporate Housing (NCH). Standard housing will be a shared bedroom and bathroom with one other person (traditional dorm style); Graduate housing (Masters/MBA/PhD/JD) will be a shared two-bedroom unit with individual rooms; married couples/registered same-sex domestic partnership housing will be a 1-bedroom/efficiency unit; and family housing will be a 1-bedroom (with infant) or 2-bedroom (with a child) unit. Specific roommate/house mate requests cannot be guaranteed and we reserve the right to re-assign you different roommates/house mates mid-internship if the need arises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Married couples/registered same-sex domestic partnership housing and family housing requires the significant other and/or family to reside in corporate housing with the intern for the entire length of the internship. The significant other is required to pick up their key from property management office separately.

                    Apple contracts with several different apartment complexes typically within 5 miles of your work location or within 3 miles from an Apple shuttle stop. You will be assigned a unit based on availability. Air conditioning and washer/dryer units are not available in all apartment units. We are unable to accommodate specific requests. We reserve the right to re-assign you to a different unit mid-internship if the need arises and when we need to consolidate back to long-term leases.

                <p>
                    Even though corporate housing may be less than 5 or 10 miles from your work location, interns with cars can still expect significant traffic delays living in the Bay Area. Rush hour traffic can be unpredictable and frustrating so understand you should always try to leave early to anticipate any possible weather or traffic delays. Interns without a car who rely on public transportation and/or the Apple shuttle system can expect on average a 60-minute door-to-door commute when you factor in the walk to the closest shuttle stop, the shuttle commute and the walk to your building. This is typical for all Apple employees who utilize the shuttles.

These items should not be tampered with by anyone other than the new arriving intern. NCH will return prior to the new intern's scheduled arrival to confirm set up.

                    Each apartment is assigned one designated parking space. It is your responsibility to confirm the location of your designated parking space. If more than one intern in your apartment unit has a car, you agree to work out a mutually agreeable parking space sharing agreement with your roommate. Cars will be subject to towing if parked illegally or in another resident's parking space. Parking spaces should not be used for storage. Any property other than an automobile stored in your designated parking space will be considered trash and removed immediately by property management. DO NOT PARK BIKES in apartment complex parking lots or store them on your back patio. Apple does not reimburse for additional assigned parking space fees. You are responsible for parking space fees or parking space fee policy changes made by individual apartment complexes during your stay in corporate housing. Additional spaces are available on a first come, first serve basis and are not guaranteed. Pricing and availability vary by property.

                    Your apartment will be thoroughly cleaned, sanitized and “bed bug free certified” prior to your move in date. You will be responsible for maintaining your apartment in good condition. This includes notifying National Corporate Housing as soon as possible if you notice any leaks, mold, etc. You may be charged for any damage and excessive cleaning fees after you move out. Failure to comply with scheduled cleaning, or to clean or remove trash from your room may result in cleaning fees and/or your removal from corporate housing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bi-weekly maid service (light dusting, vacuuming, sanitizing bathroom and kitchen) will be provided and you will be notified of the housekeeping schedule upon arrival. NCH Housekeeping will not pick up or touch personal items that may prevent the team to complete the cleaning. Prior to the scheduled cleaning, floors and beds should be cleared to allow for proper vacuuming and linen changes. Do not mix personal linens (sheets, towels, pillow cases, etc.) with NCH linens. Apple University Relations will be notified if scheduled housekeeping cleanings are missed due to uncleared beds and floors or if excessive trash is not removed on a weekly basis. Additional cleaning fees may be equally charged to the intern residents if Housekeeping is required to dispose of excessive trash.

                    Shared apartment units and bedrooms require diligent upkeep between bi-weekly housekeeping service, especially when new interns arrive, therefore, you are expected to keep your living quarters neat and tidy. No one wants to move into a messy apartment on their first day.
