			Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
		</strong>
	</h4>
	<p class="text-justify">
		COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively “the Company”) are committed to conducting business based on our visions and values (http://www.coventya.com/coventya-group/human-resources/vision-and-values) in accordance with ethical standards and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (hereinafter “the Code”) embodies this commitment. This Code applies to all directors, executive officers and employees of the Company at every level (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Employees”). 
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		The Company’s Employees are expected to read this Code and ensure that they understand and comply with the standards contained herein. Any violations of this Code, any questions about this Code, other ethical questions or the appropriate course of conduct in a particular situation should be directed to the management board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. (email: businesscode@coventya.com). 
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		<strong>
			1. Compliance with Applicable Laws, Rules and Regulations
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		All Employees must obey, both in letter and in spirit, all laws, rules and regulations that apply to the Company’s businesses, including the laws of the countries in which the Company operates. It is the responsibility of each Employee to understand and comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to his or her position in the Company. Any questions as to the applicability of any law should be directed to the managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. (email: businesscode@coventya.com).

		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		Conflicts of interests are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, unless they have been approved by the managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. A “conflict of interest” occurs when the private interest of an Employee interferes in any way with the interests of the Company. A conflict of interest can occur when an Employee takes action or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively. A conflict of interest can also occur when an Employee, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position in the Company. Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut, so Employees who have questions are encouraged to consult with higher levels of management or the managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. (email: businesscode@coventya.com).

		</strong>

	<p class="text-justify">
		All of the Company’s books, records and accounts must be maintained in reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the matters to which they relate and must conform to applicable legal requirements, financial accounting standards and the Company’s system of internal controls. All assets of the Company must be carefully and properly accounted for. The making of false or misleading records or documentation is strictly prohibited. Unrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets should not be maintained.
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		If an Employee is involved in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, he or she must do so according to applicable accounting standards and rules so that all transactions are properly and timely recorded and the financial statements fairly and completely reflect the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">

	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		<strong>
			8. Treatment of Employees
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		The diversity of the Company’s Employees is a tremendous asset. The Company is firmly committed to providing an equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and requires strict adherence to laws regarding discrimination and harassment in the workplace. The Company will not tolerate any illegal discrimination or harassment of any kind. The Company’s no-harassment policy is established under <a href="http://www.coventya.com/assets/US/NO-HARASSMENTPOLICY.pdf">http://www.coventya.com/assets/US/NO-HARASSMENTPOLICY.pdf</a>.

	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		<strong>
			9. Health and Safety
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		The Company strives to provide each Employee with a safe and healthy work environment.

	</p>

	<p class="text-justify">
		<strong>
			10. Environment
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">

		<strong>
			12. Communicating with the Public
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p class="text-justify">
		It is particularly important that external communications are accurate and consistent and do not violate Company confidentiality, applicable laws or sensitivities. Published information can have a significant effect on the Company’s reputation and have business and legal consequences. External communications could include those to news media, financial analysts and investors, our communities, our colleagues in industry, customers and other members of outside groups. The local or global marketing and/or communication services of the Company should be involved for external publications.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			13. Seeking Guidance
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		No code of business conduct and ethics can replace the thoughtful behavior of an ethical Employee or provide definitive answers to all questions. Because the Company cannot anticipate every potential situation, certain policies and procedures have been put in place to help Employees approach questions or problems as they arise. Employees are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers, or to the managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. about potential unethical or illegal behavior or an accounting, internal control or auditing matter, and the best course of action to take in a particular situation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			14. Reporting Violations
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Employees should be alert and sensitive to situations that could result in violations of this Code or applicable laws, rules or regulations. If an Employee knows of or suspects a violation of this Code or applicable laws, rules and regulations, he or she must report it immediately to his or her supervisor or manager. If he or she is not comfortable bringing up the matter with such person, or has done so and does not believe that such person has dealt with the matter properly, then he or she should raise the matter with the managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. (email: businesscode@coventya.com).
	</p>
	<p>
		The Company will not allow retaliation of any kind against any Employee for a report of a suspected or known violation made in good faith. However, any person who knowingly makes a false report of questionable behavior will be subject to disciplinary action.
	</p>
	<p>
		Reported violations will be promptly investigated. It is imperative that the person reporting the violation not conduct an investigation on his or her own. Employees are expected to cooperate fully with any internal investigation of a reported actual or possible violation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>
			15. Discipline/Penalties
		</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		The managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. shall determine, or designate appropriate persons to determine, appropriate actions to be taken in the event of a violation of this Code.

In determining what actions are appropriate in a particular case, the managing board of COVENTYA Holding S.A.S. or its designees shall take into account all relevant information, including the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was a single occurrence or repeated occurrence, whether the violation appears to have been intentional or inadvertent, whether the individual in question had been advised prior to the violation as to the proper course of action and whether the individual in question had committed other violations in the past.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action, including reprimand, suspension without pay, demotion or termination. Furthermore, certain violations of this Code are illegal and may expose the violating Employee to civil and criminal liability.
