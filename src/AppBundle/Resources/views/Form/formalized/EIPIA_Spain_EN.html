            <p>TO:  <span style="display: inline-block;"><$client.env.FormField.a01_legal_entity.HTML></span> (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”). If I become an employee of a controlled (either directly or indirectly) subsidiary or affiliate of General Electric Company in Spain, then with respect to, and for the purposes of, such employment, “Company” shall refer to such controlled subsidiary or affiliate.)</p><br>
            <p>In consideration of my employment by Company (which consideration shall include my employment with a controlled (directly or indirectly) subsidiary or affiliate of General Electric Company), and the compensation paid to me by the Company, I (“employee”) understand and agree:</p>
            <ol type="a" class="alpha_lower">
              <li>(a) to disclose and assign, and do hereby assign to the Company (or as the Company may direct) as its exclusive property, all inventions, discoveries, innovations, industrial designs, improvements, trade secrets and technical or business information which I may solely or jointly develop, conceive, reduce to practice or author during the period of my employment (1) that relate to the business or the present or demonstrated or reasonably foreseeable future research or development of the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates, or (2) that result from or are suggested by any work that I may do for the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or (3) that are otherwise made through the use of Company, or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates, time, equipment, supplies, facilities, material or secret* or confidential* information or data. To the extent that the aforementioned assignment refers to patents or utility models, said assignment shall be made in accordance with Patent Law 11/1986, or any Law which repeals and substitutes said law;</li><br>
                <li> that all original works of authorship that are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of my employment and that are protectable by copyright shall belong to the company. The company shall therefore be assigned all the rights in the reproduction, distribution, communication to the public and transformation, in all their expressions, for their exploitation throughout the world and in every language, for the legal duration of the rights in works established in the law and for use in any media that may serve as support for the work, whether physical, electronic, analogical and digital, without any limitation whatsoever. When the work is a computer program, the assignment shall extend to all the aforementioned rights both in the source code program and in the object code, as well as to all the technical manuals and documentation related to the same;</li><br>
                <li>to execute, upon the request of the Company, all necessary papers and otherwise provide proper assistance (at the Company’s expense), during and subsequent to my employment, to enable the Company to obtain for itself or its nominees (and to vest legal title in the Company or its nominees in), patents, copyrights, or other legal protection for such inventions, discoveries, innovations, improvements, original works of authorship, trade secrets and technical or business information in any and all countries;</li><br>
                <li> to make and maintain for the Company adequate and current written records of all such inventions, discoveries, innovations, improvements, original works of authorship, trade secrets and technical or business information;</li><br>
                <li> at the Company’s request, or upon any termination of my employment to deliver to the Company promptly all items that belong to the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or that by their nature are for the use of Company employees only, including, without limitation, all written and other materials that are of a secret* or confidential* nature relating to the business of the Company or its affiliates;</li><br>
                <li>not to use, publish or otherwise disclose (except as my Company duties may require), either during or subsequent to my employment, any secret* or confidential* information or data of the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or any information or data of others that the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates are obligated to maintain in confidence;</li><br>
                <li><strong> that nothing herein prevents me from reporting potential violations of law to relevant government authorities;</strong>;</li><br>
                <li> not to disclose or use in my work with the Company any secret or confidential information of others (including any prior employers), or any inventions or innovations of my own that are not included within the scope of this Agreement; </li><br>
                <li> that breach of any obligation or other provision of this Agreement may cause irreparable injury to the Company which cannot be fully compensated by money.  I therefore agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by me, the Company shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief as may be permitted by law;</li><br>
                <li> that Company may review, audit, monitor, intercept, access, and disclose information processed or stored on Company equipment and systems, or on personally-owned devices permitted Company network access to protect the security of Company, maintain proper operations of Company equipment and networks, and assure compliance with Company policies, applicable law and regulatory requirements and other business obligations; and/or for any other reason permitted by local law and/or any local agreements with works councils or unions; </li><br>
                <li> that if, at any time, I become an employee of a controlled (either directly or indirectly) subsidiary or affiliate of General Electric Company in Spain, then with respect to, and for the purposes of, such employment 1) my obligations under this Agreement shall also apply to such employment and 2) the term “Company” as used in this Agreement shall refer to such controlled subsidiary or affiliate;</li>
                <li> that Company may, in the ordinary course of business, reproduce this original Agreement by any means including ,but not limited to, electronic copying, electronic faxing or electronic scanning, storing and printing and I hereby accept, acknowledge and recognize such reproductions as authentic in lieu of this original Agreement and hereby accept (and will not object to) any use whatsoever by Company of such reproductions including, without limitation, admission and use in any proceeding in any country including those in or before any agency, patent office, court or tribunal. I further agree that such reproductions shall have the same force and effect as this original Agreement; and</li><br>
                <li> that this Agreement supersedes any provisions in any other agreement I may have signed regarding or regulating my employment that differ.  All other parts of any other agreement not in conflict shall remain valid and enforceable.  This Agreement may not be modified or terminated, in whole or part, except in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Company.  Discharge of my undertakings in this Agreement shall be an obligation of my executors, administrators, or other legal representatives or assigns.   In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction concludes that any provision (or portion of any provision) of this Agreement is unenforceable because it conflicts with the law or public policy of that jurisdiction, the parties agree that the court should first narrow or otherwise interpret the provision to the extent necessary to conform it to the law or public policy of that jurisdiction.  In the event that the court concludes that it is unable to narrow or otherwise interpret the provision so that it is neither invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.</li><br>
          </ol>
            <p>I represent that, except as stated below, I have no agreements with or obligations to others in conflict with the foregoing.</p><br>
