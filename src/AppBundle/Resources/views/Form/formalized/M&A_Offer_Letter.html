The “Average eBay Closing Price” shall be calculated based on the average of the closing prices of eBay common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the period of 10 consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the last trading day prior to the date of grant.

      RELEASE OF CLAIMS: In return for the benefits provided under the offer of employment and this Release, you waive, release, and promise never to assert any claims, known or unknown, that you might have against the eBay Inc., (the “Company”), its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, shareholders, successors, assigns and affiliates (collectively the "Released Parties"), arising out or related to your employment with the Released Parties and/or your termination of employment with the Released Parties; or otherwise arising as of the date this Relinquishment Agreement and the Company’s offer of employment to you.  The released claims include, but are not limited to, claims for compensation, bonuses, stock options, stock, and all claims arising under federal, state and local statutory or common law, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, the California Labor Code, and the law of contract and tort, and any and all claims for attorneys’ fees and costs. 
    </p>
    <p class="section">
      The released claims do not include claims that you cannot, as a matter of law, waive by private agreement, such as a right of indemnification, claims for unemployment or state disability insurance benefits, or participation in group benefit plans under COBRA.  Additionally, nothing in this Release precludes you from filing a charge or complaint with or participating in any investigation or proceeding before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  However, while you may file a charge and participate in any proceeding conducted by the Equal Opportunity Commission, by signing this Release, you waive your right to bring a lawsuit against the Company and waive your right to any individual monetary recovery in any action or lawsuit initiated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
    </p>
    <p class="section">
      RELEASE OF UNKNOWN CLAIMS.  You also waive, release and promise never to assert any such claims, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected whether or not you are aware of the nature or extent of the claims at the time that this Separation Agreement becomes effective.  You therefore waive your rights under Section 1542 of the California Civil Code and any similar law of any other state.  Section 1542 reads as follows: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”  You hereby knowingly, intentionally, and expressly waive and relinquish all rights and benefits under that section and any law of any jurisdiction of similar effect with respect to your release of any unknown or unsuspected claims you may have against the Company.
    </p>
    <p class="section">
       You have 15 calendar days from the date of this Release to consider whether to sign it.  If you agree to the terms of this Release, please sign below at any time.  On the date you sign (the "Effective Date") this will become the binding agreement between you and eBay.
