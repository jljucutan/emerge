    I acknowledge that I have reviewed and understand the documents listed above. Further I understand that, as an employee of Community College of Denver, I am expected to comply fully with the policies set forth and any acknowledgment I have made are true and accurate to the best of my knowledge. Furthermore, I agree to notify Human Resources if, in the future, I become aware of a violation of any CCD directives and/or BP and SP.
