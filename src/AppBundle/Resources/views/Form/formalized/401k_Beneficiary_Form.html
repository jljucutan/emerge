                Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (QPSA) Notice
            </h1> 
            <p class="vspace">
                If your spouse has a vested account in a retirement plan, federal law requires that you receive a special death benefit if your spouse dies before beginning to receive retirement benefits (or, if earlier, before the beginning of the period for which the retirement benefits are paid).
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                If you have been married to your spouse for at least one year (some plans may specify a shorter time period), you have the right to receive this payment for your life beginning after your spouse dies. The special death benefit is often called a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (QPSA). This death benefit will automatically be paid in a lump sum rather than as a QPSA if the value of the death benefit is $5,000* or less.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                If the lump-sum value of the death benefit is greater than $5,000, the death benefit will be paid in the form of a QPSA. Other options may be available. The actual amount of the QPSA benefit will vary depending on the vested account balance, your age and the cost to purchase the benefit.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                Your right to the QPSA benefit provided by federal law cannot be taken away unless you agree to give up that benefit. If you agree, your spouse can choose to have all or part of the death benefit paid to someone else. The person your spouse chooses to receive the death benefit is usually called the beneficiary. As an example, if you agree, your spouse can have the death benefit paid to his or her children instead of you.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                <strong class="text-blue">Example:</strong> Pat and Robin Doe agree that Robin will not receive the QPSA benefit. Pat and Robin also decide that half of the death benefit that is paid from Pat’s vested account will be paid to Robin, and half of the death benefit will be paid to Pat and Robin’s child, Chris. The total death benefit is $200 per month. After Pat dies, the plan will pay $100 per month to Robin for the rest of Robin’s life. Chris will also receive payments from the plan as long as he lives. Chris will receive less than $100 per month because Chris, being younger than Robin, is expected to receive payments over a longer period.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                Your choice to give up the QPSA benefit must be voluntary. It is your personal decision if you want to give up the right. If you sign this agreement, your spouse can choose the beneficiary who will receive the death benefit without telling you and without getting your agreement. Your spouse can change the beneficiary at any time before he or she begins receiving benefits or dies. You have the right to agree to allow your spouse to select only a particular beneficiary. If you want to allow your spouse to select only a particular beneficiary, check the box in Choice C under the My Beneficiary Choices section, which will limit the beneficiary choice to the one designated on this form.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                You can agree to give up all or part of the QPSA benefit. If you do so, the plan will pay you the part of the benefit you did not give up, and pay the remaining part of the benefit to the person or persons selected by your spouse.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                You can change your mind with respect to giving up your right to the QPSA benefit until the date your spouse dies. After that date, you cannot change this agreement. If you change your mind, you must notify the plan administrator in writing that you want to revoke the consent you give on this form.
            </p>
            <p class="vspace">
                You may lose your right to the QPSA benefit if your spouse and you become legally separated or divorced even if you do not sign this agreement. However, if you become legally separated or divorced, you might be able to get a special court order called a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) that specifically protects your rights to receive the QPSA benefit or that gives you other benefits under this plan. If you are thinking about separating or getting a divorce, you should get legal advice on your rights to benefits from the plan.

I also understand that if the value of the QPSA benefit is $5,000* or less, the plan will pay the benefit to me in one lump-sum payment.
