In consideration for Employee entering into this Agreement, Employer will provide Employee with Confidential Information that Employee would not be given in absence of entering into this Agreement.  Employee agrees not to use, disclose or exploit any Confidential Business Information belonging to Employer, or provided to Employer by a third party pursuant to an obligation of confidentiality, except as necessary to perform Employee’s duties on behalf of Employer.  The obligations stated in this Section 2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and/or the termination of Employee's employment with Employer and shall continue for so long as such data or information meets the definition of Confidential Business Information as stated below.  Employee further agrees to take all appropriate action, whether by instruction, agreement or otherwise, to insure the protection, confidentiality and security of all Confidential Business Information.  For purposes of this Agreement, “<u>Confidential Business Information</u>” means any information (i) relating to the business of Employer, (ii) disclosed to Employee or of which Employee is aware due to his employment with Employer, (iii) that has value to Employer, and (iv) that is not generally known to competitors of Employer.  Examples of Employer’s Confidential Business Information include non-public information about: Employer’s methods of operation; marketing, recruiting, and placement strategies; names of customers and clients and prospective customers and clients specifically targeted by Employer; names, responsibilities and needs and preferences of the personnel of Employer’s current and prospective customers and clients who purchase staffing services; past, current and prospective consultant lists and consultant information; past, current, and prospective employee lists and employee information; employee and consultant performance and productivity information; employee and consultant compensation rates and structure; costs, pricing, margins, and related information and projections; client account books; personnel data; and similar information; provided, however, that Confidential Business Information shall not include data or information (x) that has been voluntarily disclosed to the public by Employer (although not by Employee without authorization of Employer), (y) that has been independently developed and disclosed by others with proper authority to do so, or (z) that has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means.  Confidential Business Information may also include, without limitation, non-public information relating to Employer’s legal affairs, financial accounting, employee disciplinary matters, internal investigations, and other nonpublic information, the disclosure of which could injure Employer.  Employer’s Confidential Business Information includes information that may also constitute Trade Secrets (as defined below) because the terms are not intended to be mutually exclusive.  Employee’s agreement to protect Confidential Business Information belonging to Employer extends to instances in which Employee is using non-Employer computer resources, such as personal e-mail, internet and instant messaging accounts, as well as computer equipment not owned by Employer.  Employee further agrees to report immediately to Employer any incident that may compromise or has compromised Confidential Business Information, including, without limitation, the loss or theft of any hard copy of such information, any disk or drive containing such information, or any laptop or desktop computer, whether Employer-owned or otherwise, containing such information.

        3. <u>TRADE SECRETS</u>.  In consideration for Employee entering into this Agreement, Employer will provide Employee with Trade Secrets that Employee would not be given in absence of entering into this Agreement.  Employee agrees not to use or disclose any Trade Secret of Employer without Employer’s prior written consent.  “<u>Trade Secret</u>” means information, without regard to form, including, but not limited to, technical or nontechnical data, a formula, an invention, a pattern, a compilation, a program, a device, a method, a technique, a drawing, a process, financial data, financial plans, product plans, marketing or business development plans, or a list of actual or potential customers or clients or their personnel, consultants, or employees which:  (i) is not commonly known by or available to the public; (ii) derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (iii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  The obligation not to disclose a Trade Secret shall remain in effect during Employee’s employment and shall continue for as long as the information remains a Trade Secret under applicable law.  Consistent with the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, nothing set forth in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent Employee from (and Employee will not be held criminally or civilly liable for) any disclosure of a trade secret so long as such disclosure is (i) made in confidence directly or indirectly to a federal, state or local government official, or to an attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or (ii) made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding under seal.  Federal law also provides that an individual who files a lawsuit for employer retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to a court order.
