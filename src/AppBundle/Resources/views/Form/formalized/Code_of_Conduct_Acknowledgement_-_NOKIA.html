    As a candidate for employment with Alcatel-Lucent (doing business as “Nokia”, and hereafter “Nokia”), I acknowledge that I have received and have fully reviewed the Nokia Code of Conduct. I further acknowledge and also agree that the Code of Conduct sets forth some of the terms, conditions and obligations for my employment by Nokia. I understand that it is my responsibility to abide by the rules and standards set forth in the Code of Conduct as well as all Nokia policies. I also understand that my employment by Nokia is at will, and that I have no express or implied contract with Nokia concerning the terms and conditions of my employment. Both I and Nokia have the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. I further acknowledge that I have not relied, or will not rely, upon any representations to the contrary, either in accepting employment with Nokia or in continuing my employment with Nokia. I also understand that Nokia reserves the right to change, amend or suspend the Code of Conduct or any other Nokia policy at any time within applicable legal parameters and without prior notice to me and said policies do not create any contractual commitments by Nokia.

The DTSA provides immunity from civil and criminal liability under federal or state trade secret law for employees who disclose trade secrets in confidence to federal, state or local government officials, or to attorneys, in each case “solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law,” or in court filings made under seal.
