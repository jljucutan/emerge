        If any Claim is not subject to release, to the extent permitted by law, Employee also waives any right or ability to be a class or collective action representative or to otherwise participate in any putative or certified class or collective or multi-party action or proceeding based on such a Claim in which any Released Party is a party.

        Further, Employee agrees and covenants not to file, initiate, or join any lawsuit (either individually, with others, or as part of a class), in any forum, pleading, raising, or asserting any Claim(s) barred or released by Section 2 of this Agreement. If Employee does so, and the action is found to be barred in whole or in part by this Agreement, Employee agrees to pay the attorneys’ fees and costs, or the proportions thereof, incurred by the applicable Released Party in defending against those Claims that are found to be barred by Section 2 of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section precludes Employee from challenging the validity of the release in Section 2 under the requirements of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and Employee shall not be responsible for reimbursing the attorneys’ fees and costs of the Released Parties in connection with such a challenge to the validity of the release. Employee, however, acknowledges that the release in Section 2 applies to all Claims that Employee has under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and that, unless the release is held to be invalid, all of Employee’s Claims under that Act shall be extinguished by execution of this Agreement. Employee further agrees that nothing in this Section shall preclude or prevent Employee from filing a charge with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or similar state or local agency. Employee agrees that Employee will not seek or accept any relief obtained on Employee’s behalf by any government agency, private party, class, or otherwise with respect to any Claims released in this Agreement.
