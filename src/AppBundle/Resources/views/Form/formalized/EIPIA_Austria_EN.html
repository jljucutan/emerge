      <p>TO the GE entity that is employing me (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”). If I become an Employee of a controlled (either directly or indirectly) subsidiary or affiliate of General Electric Company in Austria, then with respect to, and for the purposes of, such Employment, “Company” shall refer to such controlled subsidiary or affiliate):</p><br />
      <p>In consideration of my employment by Company (which consideration shall include my employment controlled (directly or indirectly) subsidiary or affiliate of Company), and the compensation paid to me by the Company, I (“employee”) understand and agree subject to any compulsory provisions of Austrian Law as follows:
 </p>     <br />
      <ol type="a" class="alpha_lower">
        <li>to disclose promptly and assign to the Company (or as the Company may direct) without delay as its exclusive property, all inventions, discoveries, innovations, improvements, trade secrets and technical or business information which I may solely or jointly develop, conceive, reduce to practice or author during the period of my employment (1) that relate to the business or the present or demonstrated or reasonably foreseeable future research or development of the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates, or (2) that result from or are suggested by any work that I may do for the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or (3) that are otherwise made through the use of Company, or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates, time, equipment, supplies, facilities, material or secret* or confidential* information or data;</li><br />
        <li>to grant to the Company a term of 4 months (unless a collective labour agreement, i.e., “kollektivvertrag” setting a term of 3 months applies, in which case a term of 3 months applies) after the disclosure of the invention, discovery, innovation, improvement, trade secret and technical or business information to decide whether the Company will accept the same or not;</li><br />
        <li>that all original works of authorship that are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of my employment and that are protectable by copyright are works made in fulfillment of an official duty or made upon order, respectively, and I further agree that I will disclose and herewith grant to the Company (or as the Company may direct) the exclusive right to use in any respect any such original work of authorship;</li><br />
        <li>to execute, upon the request of the Company, all necessary papers and otherwise provide proper assistance (at the Company’s expense), during and subsequent to my employment, to enable the Company to obtain for itself or its nominees, patents, copyrights, or other legal protection of whatever nature as provided for in the relevant jurisdictions for such inventions, discoveries, innovations, improvements, original works of authorship, trade secrets and technical or business information in any and all countries;</li><br />
        <li>at the Company’s request, or upon any termination of my employment to deliver to the Company promptly all items that belong to the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or that by their nature are for the use of Company employees only, including, without limitation, all written and other materials that are of a secret* or confidential* nature relating to the business of the Company or its affiliates;</li><br />
        <li>not to use, publish or otherwise disclose (except as my Company duties may require), either during or subsequent to my employment, any secret* or confidential* information or data of the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates or any information or data of others that the Company or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates are obligated to maintain in confidence;</li><br />
        <li><strong>that nothing herein prevents me from reporting potential violations of law to relevant government authorities;</strong>;</li><br />
        <li>not to disclose or use in my work with the Company any secret* or confidential* information of others (including any prior employers), or any inventions or innovations of my own that are not included within the scope of this Agreement; </li><br />
        <li>that my personal data will be collected and processed in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Data Protection Act pursuant to GE’s Employment Data Protection Standards: <a href="http://supportcentral.ge.com/*EDPStandards">http://supportcentral.ge.com/*EDPStandards</a>. I confirm that GE’s Employment Data Protection Standards are known to me and I fully agree with all its provisions. I also understand that GE may from time to time change or amend these Standards.</li><br />
        <li> that if, at any time, I become an employee of a controlled (either directly or indirectly) subsidiary or affiliate of General Electric Company in Austria, then with respect to, and for purposes of, such employment 1) my obligations under this Agreement shall also apply to such employment and 2) the term “Company” as used in this Agreement shall refer to such controlled subsidiary or affiliate. </li><br />
        <li> that Company may, in the ordinary course of business, reproduce this original Agreement by any means including, but not limited to, electronic copying, electronic faxing or electronic scanning, storing and printing and I hereby accept, acknowledge and recognize such reproductions as authentic in lieu of this original Agreement and hereby accept (and will not object to) any use whatsoever by Company of such reproductions including, without limitation, admission and use in any proceeding in any country including those in or before any agency, patent office, court or tribunal.  I further agree that such reproductions shall have the same force and effect as this original Agreement.</li><br />
        <li> that remuneration for employees inventions as provided for and defined by Austrian law will be set individually once the Company has decided to take up and accept or to use such invention and the patentability of the invention has been proven and the invention is put to use. The employee, however, will receive a premium when his/her invention is applied for as patent or utility model. This premium is deductible from any future payment of a remuneration. In case of several joint inventors, it will be proportionally divided among the joint inventors. If the employee is employed for R&D work, then no additional remuneration is payable since it is anyway included in the ordinary salary, but the premium shall still be paid. All inventions are to be communicated to the general manager in writing in complete detail and where appropriate with drawings as soon as possible. </li><br />
        <li>that this Agreement supersedes any provisions in any other agreement I may have signed regarding or regulating my employment that differ.  All other parts of any other agreement not in conflict shall remain valid and enforceable.  This Agreement may not be modified or terminated, in whole or part, except in writing signed by both parties.  Discharge of my undertakings in this Agreement shall be an obligation of my executors, administrators, or other legal representatives or assigns.   In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction concludes that any provision (or portion of any provision) of this Agreement is unenforceable because it conflicts with the law or public policy of that jurisdiction, the parties agree that the court should first narrow or otherwise interpret the provision to the extent necessary to conform it to the law or public policy of that jurisdiction.  In the event that the court concludes that it is unable to narrow or otherwise interpret the provision so that it is neither invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.</li><br />

      </ol>
      <p>I represent that, except as stated below, I have no agreements with or obligations to others in conflict with the foregoing.</p><br />
      <p style='text-indent: 30px;' class='italic'>*<em>These terms are used in the ordinary sense and do not refer to the official security classifications of any government.
