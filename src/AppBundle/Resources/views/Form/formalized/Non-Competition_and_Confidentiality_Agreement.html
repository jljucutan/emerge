  </p>

  <div class="subheading vspace border-bottom">
    <h3><strong>Non-Competition and Confidentiality Agreement</strong></h3>
  </div>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (d) The Company’s “Competitors” are defined as companies that are competitively bidding on the same business opportunities as the Company, and include any business whose service or products compete with or are substantially similar to the Company’s services or products and that operates or provides services within the non-compete market specified in Paragraph 2(c) below anytime during two years immediately preceding the termination of Employee’s employment with the Company.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (e) “Becoming associated with” includes, without limitation, performing any services for, receiving any compensation from or holding any ownership interest (to hold harmless any shares the Employee earned or purchased as part of participating in a Competitor’s employer-sponsored retirement plan (401(k)) or employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) as an employee prior to joining the Company; or shares gained through investing in mutual funds where the composition of those funds are not controlled by its individual investors) in any of the Company’s Competitors, or having any such obligation or right.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (f) The Company’s “Existing Customers” are all people and businesses with which the Company does business or provides any products or services while the Employee is employed with the Company.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (g) The Company’s “Prospective Customers” are all people and businesses the Company has identified for itself and that are known or reasonably should be known to the Employee as being sufficiently likely to use the Company’s services or products to warrant marketing efforts by the Company within six months before or after the termination of Employee’s employment with the Company.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace">
    2. <strong>Agreement Not to Compete</strong>.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (a) <u>Prohibited Actions</u>. During the applicable time period specified in Paragraph 2(b) below, the Employee will not compete with the Company, which means the Employee will not: (i) convert for personal benefit any business opportunity the Employee knows or has reason to know the Company is pursuing or would be interested in pursuing; (ii) become associated (directly or indirectly) with any of the Company’s Competitors; (iii) for the Employee’s own benefit, or for the benefit of any of the Company’s Competitors or any other person or business, solicit or accept any business from any of the Company’s Existing or Prospective Customers; or (iv) create or form any business entity, whether a sole proprietorship or other form of business entity and whether owned in whole or in part by the Employee, the principal purpose of which is to pursue in any way or do any of the prohibited things listed above in (i) through (iii). This limitation applies only to a position with the Competitors (or their partners) involved in bidding business opportunities that the Company has in production, in Customer evaluation, or projected to be worked on in the six months following the Employee’s voluntary or involuntary termination. The Company will provide a list of these Competitors (and partners) as an attachment to this agreement as a part of the Employee’s out-processing.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (b) <u>Period During which the Employee Will Not Compete</u>. The term of the Employee’s agreement not to compete will begin on the effective date of this Agreement, will be in force during the Employee’s employment with the Company and will end six (6) months after the termination of Employee’s employment with the Company. If the Employee violates this agreement not to compete, however, the term will automatically extend during all such competition and will not run again until after the Employee stops competing with the Company, so the Company is free from competition from the Employee for the full period stated above.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (c) <u>Market in which the Employee Will Not Compete</u>. Employee acknowledges that the services of the Company are marketed to the federal government, through its various departments and agencies, throughout the United States and in foreign locations, and that the Company competes with other entities that are or could be located in any part of the United States or even in foreign locations. Therefore, Employee agrees that the prohibitions set forth in Paragraph 2(a) shall be effective throughout the market, for contract services to the United States federal government, without regard to geographic location.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace text-indent">
    (d) <u>Acknowledgments</u>. The Employee acknowledges that the term of this Agreement is a minimum period of time, that the prohibited actions are reasonably limited, and that the area of restriction is reasonable and necessary to protect the Company, consistent with provisions of C.R.S. &sect; 8-2-113, and Colorado’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act, C.R.S. &sect;&sect; 7-74-101-110.
  </p>


  <p class="vspace">
    3. <strong>Confidential Information Belongs Solely to the Company</strong>. The Company’s Confidential Information relating to the Company’s business and Existing and Prospective Customers are Company’s exclusive property. The Employee, therefore, agrees that:
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent">
    (a) All notes, data, reference materials, sketches, drawings, memoranda, disks, documentation and records in any way incorporating or reflecting any of the Confidential Information and all proprietary rights in the Confidential Information, including copyrights, trade secrets, trade marks and patents shall belong exclusively to the Company;
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent">
    (b) At all times during the Employee’s employment with the Company, the Employee will keep secret and will not disclose to any third party, take or misuse any of the Company’s Confidential Information the Employee acquires or has access to because of that employment, including the names, addresses, contact people or other identifying information for any of the Company’s Existing or Prospective Customers;
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent">
    (c) At any time during or after the Employee’s employment with the Company, the Employee will not use or seek to use any of the Company’s Confidential Information for the Employee’s own benefit or for the benefit of any other person or business or in any way adverse to the Company’s interests;
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent">
    (d) On the Company’s request or on termination of employment, the Employee will promptly return to the Company all its property, specifically including all documents, disks, or other computer media or other materials in the Employee’s possession or control that contain any of the Company’s Confidential Information;
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent">
    (e) After termination of employment, the Employee will preserve the secrecy of and will not disclose directly or indirectly to any other person or business any of the Company’s Confidential Information;
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent vspace">
    (f) The Employee will promptly advise the Company of any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Company’s Confidential Information by any person or entity.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace">
    The Company and Employee agree this provision is intended to express the Company’s rights and the Employee’s duties to the Company, including under the Colorado Uniform Trade Secrets Act, C.R.S. &sect;&sect; 7-74-101-110.
  </p>

  <p>
    4. <strong>Relief the Company May Seek</strong>. The Employee further agrees that, if the Employee violates this Agreement, it would be difficult to determine the damages and lost profits, which the Company would suffer as a result of such breach including, but not limited to, losses attributable to lost confidential information and increased competition. Accordingly, the Employee agrees that if the Employee violates this Agreement, Employee is subject to discipline up to and including termination, as well as the following:
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent">
    (a) <u>Injunctive Relief</u>. The Company will be entitled to an Order for injunctive relief and/or specific performance, or their equivalent, from a court or an arbitrator, including requirements that the Employee take action or refrain from action to avoid competing with the Company, to preserve the secrecy of the Company’s Confidential Information and to protect the Company from additional damages, and the Employee agrees the Company does not need to post a bond to obtain an injunction and waives the Employee’s right to require such a bond; and
  </p>

  <p class="text-indent vspace">
    (b) <u>Liquidated Damages</u>. The Company will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of $10,000 for each idea, concept, product, process, application or customer the Company loses as its confidential property as a result of Employee’s violation of this Agreement, which amount is the Company’s best approximation in entering into this Agreement of the value of the obligations the Employee is agreeing to meet and of the damages the Company will suffer if the Employee breaches any of the Employee’s obligations.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace">
    5. <strong>Employment Rights</strong>. Employee acknowledges that he/she continues to be an employee “at will” under the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not a contract for future employment and does not change the fact that Employee's employment may be terminated at any time by either the Employee or the Company.
  </p>

    <h3><strong>Non-Competition and Confidentiality Agreement</strong></h3>
  </div>

  <p class="vspace">
    6. <strong>Resolution of Disputes</strong>. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company has the option to arbitrate any dispute between the Company and Employee regarding any aspect of this Agreement through binding arbitration by the Judicial Arbiter Group, Inc. of Denver, Colorado. The Company may waive its arbitration option by filing a lawsuit against or naming the Employee. In any lawsuit or claim the Employee brings against or naming the Company, the Company will have until the date its answer or other response is due in that lawsuit to notify the Employee that it will exercise its arbitration option.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace">
    7. <strong>Entire Agreement; Amendment; Choice of Law; Severability</strong>. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement between the Company and Employee regarding Employee’s agreement not to compete. This Agreement may be amended by a written document signed by both an authorized representative of the Company and the Employee. This Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under Colorado law. Any unenforceable provision of this Agreement will be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable or, if that is not possible, will be severed from this Agreement, and the remainder of this Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent possible.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace">
    8. <strong>Attorney’s Fees, Expert’s Fees, Costs and Arbitration Fees</strong>. In any litigation or arbitration of any dispute between the Company and Employee, in addition to any relief, order or award that enters, the prevailing party will be awarded reasonable attorney’s fees, expert witness fees and costs, and the party who does not prevail will pay the arbitration fees in any arbitration.
  </p>

  <p class="vspace">
    The Company and Employee have each read and considered this Agreement carefully, understand each provision, and have conferred, or have had the opportunity to confer, with their respective attorneys before executing this Agreement.
